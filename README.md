# Amazon Clone

This is a work-in-progress project where I am building a clone of the Amazon website. The goal of this project is to practice and enhance my front-end development skills by replicating the design and functionality of a real-world e-commerce platform.

## Current Features
- **Header Section**: Includes a navigation bar with a logo, search bar, sign-in option, and cart.
- **Hero Section**: Displays a message and a link to the Amazon application.
- **Shop Section**: Contains product categories with images and "See More" links.
- **Footer Section**: Includes links to various pages like Careers, Blogs, About Amazon, and more.

## Future Plans
I am actively working on adding more features to this project. Here are some of the planned updates:
- **Responsive Design**: Make the website fully responsive for mobile and tablet devices.
- **Dynamic Content**: Add JavaScript to make the website interactive (e.g., functional search bar, dynamic cart).
- **Product Details Page**: Create a separate page for individual product details.
- **Backend Integration**: Add a backend to handle user authentication, product data, and cart functionality.
